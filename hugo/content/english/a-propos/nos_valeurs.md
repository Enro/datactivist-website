      text: "Opening data, and more widely, the knowledge it is based on, can reduce information asymmetries and create a fair environment between all stakeholders. Open data enhances transparency of public policies, boosts innovation, and knocks down organisation walls. The data allow a common reference to set up, they empower reality: they are never neutral and can be activated to serve a goal. We want to allow everyone to manipulate data, without naivety, but without pessimism"
  - "We support those who create change":

      text: "Data opening and use require considerable work, often invisible and not taken into account. We bring together the diversity of our skills, our expertise and our professionalism to help our private or public customers to achieve their ambition. To create change, journalists, NGOs, and digital facilitation stakeholders have a key role to grow the audience of data. "
  - "We encourage independence and fulfillment at work":

      text: "YOLO: we only live once, the time we spend working must be as much useful, fulfilling and respectful  as possible, to find a balance between professional and personal life. At Datactivist, employees have a great independence in the way they plan their work and manage their working time. Information sharing and kindness are the rule. Presenteeism is not part of our values, we prefer efficiency. We also tend to 0 paper use, we use extensively collaborative work tools, and actively fight against meetings. The team operates in remote, distributed throughout France, mobile and as close as possible to our customers."
  - "We create commons":

      text: "We want open data to become a shared resource and managed by the community. In other words a common. Our status of cooperative and participatory society testifies that Datactivist is governed democratically by its employees in order to sustain our jobs and our business project. We apply ourselves to the principles we defend: Datactivist's work is freely reusable, as it is published under the Creative Commons BY-SA license. Finally, we launched the TeamOpenData community to gather professional stakeholders of open data, and we are developing an open source framework for data opening."
