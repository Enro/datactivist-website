    text: "Datactivist enabled the development of a technical activities program that is consistent and creative, but especially accessible to all targeted participants. With its knowledge of the open gov / open data network, Datactivist allowed the project to be part of a complex and constantly changing ecosystem. Finally, I really appreciated the strong availability of the team outside the mission, to finalize the project process and to follow up, both with the partners ... and with myself!

Together we developed social data analysis methodologies with R that require high skills in both coding and opinion strategies. It was a successful partnership that has allowed us to make a real leap forward, an adventure far from over."
